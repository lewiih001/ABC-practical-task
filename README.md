  INTRODUCTION:
   Rapid growth in ecommerce and changing consumer preferences have contributed to the
growing popularity of online auctioning platforms such as eBay. Online platforms provide some advantages
to consumers such as product variety, deals on prices and mitigate geographical barriers. Nevertheless,
existing auction platforms are centralized and depend on third-party intermediaries for transaction
settlement. As a result, online platforms raise critical concerns regarding data integrity, security,
transparency, and traceability as potential bidders have to trust the organizer for legitimacy of bids. Thus,
adopting a decentralized approach using blockchain technology can transform the auction process,
eliminating intermediaries, ensure transparency and reduce transaction costs.

PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM
The purpose of the system is to offer convenience as bidders are not
geographically restricted to place their bids, unlike in traditional auctions bidders have to be physically
present. The main participants in the auction process include seller, bidders as potential buyers and a third-
party vendor [1]. In online auction process, potential bidders submit their offers (bids) using an online
platform where they compete against one another anonymously for a fixed time duration. Conducting E-
auctions is advantageous over traditional bidding systems as it reduces the cycle time and cost for buyers
who are ready to procure goods and services. Online auctions can be effectively addressed by adopting blockchain
technology, a decentralized system. 

SYSTEM CONTENT
Blockchain-based auctions can effectively remove intermediaries
thereby reducing transaction costs and ensure trust among stakeholders . Smart contracts enable business
rules and logic agreed by participating entities to be programmed in the contract that are automatically
executed when the previously agreed conditions are met . These contracts act as software agents that
automate and enforce agreements through the execution of tamper-proof codes . These contracts are
beneficial in business collaborations which require all stakeholders to be aware of which stage the process
is in along with its resulting outcome. 

INTERACTION OF THE SYSTEM WITH OTHER PRODUCT COMPONENTS
The system is automatic between autioneers and bidders.

The system is automated and performs transaction on request,it also verifies bidder details.

SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM

Data integrity;blockchain platform conducting online auctions would
mitigate the risk of false bidding and helps in keeping track of the bid history as data stored on the chain is
tamper-proof since the transactions are chained together using tamper-proof cryptography technology
Privacy;blockchain based approach is most suited as all data concerning users are stored securely and cannot be
accessed even under malicious cyberattacks and unexpected failures.
Authencation and access control;the system provides access control elliminating need of third party limiting only authorized users to participate in the bidding process and privatizing bidding information such as the leading bid and bid history.
 The users need to be verified once they register .
the system overcomes security concerns pertaining to data
integrity, privacy, data tampering, authentication and access control and resilient to common forms of
cyber-attacks such as DDoS
